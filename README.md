# Local Wireframe Agent Workflow

This document outlines the complete, end-to-end process for our local agent, which transforms an audio recording into a live website prototype.

### Phase 1: Input & Transcription

1.  **User Uploads Audio:** The user opens `index.html` in their browser, selects an audio file, and clicks the "Start" button.
2.  **Frontend Sends to Agent:** The `script.js` on the webpage sends the audio file to our local Python agent (the `agent.py` script running on your machine).
3.  **Agent Transcribes with AssemblyAI:**
    *   The Python agent receives the audio file.
    *   It uploads the file to AssemblyAI and starts a transcription job.
    *   It waits until AssemblyAI finishes processing and returns the complete, formatted text transcript.

### Phase 2: AI Generation & Content Creation

4.  **Agent Generates Content with Gemini:**
    *   The agent takes the text transcript from AssemblyAI.
    *   It creates a detailed prompt for Gemini. This prompt will ask Gemini to perform two tasks:
        1.  Write a clear, structured **wireframe description** based on the transcript.
        2.  Generate the complete **HTML code for an `index.html` file** that visually represents that wireframe.
    *   The agent sends this prompt to the Gemini API and gets back the generated text and HTML code.

### Phase 3: Deployment & Notification

5.  **Agent Creates GitHub Repository:**
    *   Using a GitHub Personal Access Token (which we'll store securely), the agent connects to the GitHub API.
    *   It creates a new, public repository with a unique name (e.g., `wireframe-project-2025-07-29-1030`).
6.  **Agent Pushes `index.html` to GitHub:**
    *   The agent takes the HTML code generated by Gemini.
    *   It uses the GitHub API to create a new file named `index.html` inside the new repository and commits it.
7.  **Agent Activates GitHub Pages:**
    *   The agent makes another call to the GitHub API for the new repository.
    *   It sends a command to **enable GitHub Pages**, using the `main` branch as the source.
    *   GitHub will automatically start deploying the `index.html` file as a live, public website.
8.  **Agent Sends Email Notification:**
    *   The agent will connect to an email service.
    *   It will compose and send an email to a specified address. This email will contain:
        *   The original transcript.
        *   The wireframe description from Gemini.
        *   A link to the new GitHub repository.
        *   A link to the live GitHub Pages website (e.g., `https://your-username.github.io/wireframe-project-....`).
9.  **Agent Responds to Frontend:**
    *   Finally, the Python agent sends a success message back to the user's browser.
    *   The `script.js` receives this message and updates the webpage to show the user the process is complete, displaying the links to the GitHub repo and the live site.
